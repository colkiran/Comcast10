Closures
--------
1. function enclosed into another function
2. varaible declared in a different memory is been accessed in different memory
3. we are able to access the function through its reference even after deleting the outerfun

This is the point here. A Python3 closure is when some data gets attached to the code.

So, this value is remembered even when the variable goes out of scope, or the function is removed from the namespace.
